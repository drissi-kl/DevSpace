## **Title**: My Digital Showcase — DRISSI Abderrahmane.

My personal space on the web where design meets logic. I developed this portfolio to be more than just a gallery of work; it is a comprehensive web application that demonstrates my ability to build powerful applications from the ground up. I utilized Express to construct a robust API and Vue.js to create engaging, interactive interfaces, with a primary focus on high performance and clean, maintainable source code.
